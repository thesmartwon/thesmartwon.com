#### TLDR;
1. Find your frame size using [this chart.](https://www.evanscycles.com/en-us/help/bike-sizing-road)
2. Visit [craigslist bicycles](https://raleigh.craigslist.org/search/bia?hasPic=1&bundleDuplicates=1&searchNearby=2&nearbyArea=367&nearbyArea=335&nearbyArea=273&nearbyArea=61&nearbyArea=634&nearbyArea=272&min_price=90&max_price=500) (I have the filters set up for you).
3. Click the X on anything that [looks like what you'd see in Target or Walmart.](http://www.randomthoughts.fyi/2012/01/buying-bikes-from-craigslist.html) Also click the X on bikes that are too big or small for you.
	- More commonly you'll be clicking the X on weird bikes, or things that aren't bikes at all!
4. Test ride 2-3 bikes near you and buy one.
	- People are constantly test riding bikes (especially the $200+ ones), so don't feel weird asking.
	- To be polite, trade your ID for a test ride so that the seller knows you won't steal the bike. Makes it pretty easy to report you to the police :)
	- If you can't decide between two, post to [reddit.com/r/whichbike](https://www.reddit.com/r/whichbike/).

#### Recommendations
1. I gotta go fast enough for class, and I want to bike on grass, some gravel, and mud. I want to carry 30-50lbs extra on it. => Buy a [hybrid bike](https://raleigh.craigslist.org/search/bia?query=hybrid&hasPic=1&bundleDuplicates=1&searchNearby=2&nearbyArea=367&nearbyArea=335&nearbyArea=273&nearbyArea=61&nearbyArea=634&nearbyArea=272&min_price=90&max_price=500)
2. I gotta go fastest for class, but I won't be biking on grass, gravel, or mud. I won't carry heavy things on it. => Buy a [road bike](https://raleigh.craigslist.org/search/bia?query=road&hasPic=1&bundleDuplicates=1&searchNearby=2&nearbyArea=367&nearbyArea=335&nearbyArea=273&nearbyArea=61&nearbyArea=634&nearbyArea=272&min_price=90&max_price=500)
3. I gotta go fastest for class, and I want to bike on grass, mud, and some gravel. I won't carry heavy things on it. => Buy a [cyclocross bike (very limited supply)](https://raleigh.craigslist.org/search/bia?query=cyclocross&hasPic=1&bundleDuplicates=1&searchNearby=2&nearbyArea=367&nearbyArea=335&nearbyArea=273&nearbyArea=61&nearbyArea=634&nearbyArea=272&min_price=90&max_price=500)
4. I just gotta go for class, and I want to climb crazy mountains, be able to haul 50lbs+, and push my bike to the low-gear limit! => Buy a [mountain bike](https://raleigh.craigslist.org/search/bia?query=mountain&hasPic=1&bundleDuplicates=1&searchNearby=2&nearbyArea=367&nearbyArea=335&nearbyArea=273&nearbyArea=61&nearbyArea=634&nearbyArea=272&min_price=90&max_price=500)

# The Story
I recently bought a bike after religously checking [Craigslist with these filters](https://raleigh.craigslist.org/search/bia?hasPic=1&bundleDuplicates=1&searchNearby=2&nearbyArea=367&nearbyArea=335&nearbyArea=273&nearbyArea=61&nearbyArea=634&nearbyArea=272&min_price=90&max_price=500) for a month, and I'd like to share the process I went through. I'm a huge fan of bikes and the [lifestyle they encourage.](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/04/18/get-rich-with-bikes/) Oh yeah, I also signed myself up for a triathlon class (and it's 2 hours straight), and most of my classmates seem to be normal college kids who either have:

1. a department store bike
2. no bike

both of which are equally bad at going fast. Don't even get me started on how low-quality department store bikes are, those things are literally just toys. I used one (a Schwinn) for the past 2 semesters to commute between classes, and the poor thing fell apart on me at the end of last year with less than 1000 miles. For the class, you can scrape by with a one, but beware quality issues, and especially going slow.

Luckily, buying used bikes ($100+) is easier than ever in the age of the internet. Unluckily, doing research is necessary or you'll end up buy yourself a bike that doesn't fit, has a major problem, or maybe some other bothersome issue.

Picking your bike out is really about asking yourself what you want to do **other** than triathlon. See my "Recommendations" in the TDLR; above for the most common use cases.

To make an informed decision about buying a used bike, I think you have to:

1. Find your size.
2. Understand you're actually investing in a frame. So understand different types of frames and what they're good at.
3. Understand wheels and other components (derailleurs, crank-sets, brakes, and shifters) and what makes them work.
4. Understand comfort (seat and handlebars).
5. Get a BicycleBlueBook quote.
6. Apply 2-4 when you inspect the bike!

If you do all of those things, I think you'll find yourself a bike that's a keeper just like I did!

## 1. Finding your size
Most non-department store bikes are measured by their [seat tube length.](https://www.evanscycles.com/help/bike-sizing) This determines how far your legs have to go to touch the pedals. The best way to find your frame size is to measure your inseam length (foot to crotch.) Find it by putting the spine of a book in your crotch and measuring from the floor to the top of the spine. Convert your inseam to cm. Multiply by .67. That's around the size bike you want. If you're too lazy to do all this, you can use a [guesstimate chart.](https://www.evanscycles.com/help/bike-sizing-road) The best options is to go to a bike shop (there's a lot nearby...) and just test ride bikes, keeping track of their size. I wouldn't reccomend getting professionally sized (which includes a whole lot of other stuff) since it usually costs money.

## 2. Understanding different frames
A frame is the core of the bike, and it determines all the other components you can use on it. Therefore, when you're buying a bike you expect to maintain/upgrade in the future, then you are really investing in a frame. Bikes have been around a long time, but current frame materials haven't. Steel was first, then aluminum, and only in the last 20 years or so have carbon fiber frames become a consumer product. They will all get the job done, but with a few minor differences:

# [Steel (is real)](http://road.cc/content/buyers-guide/194720-18-best-steel-road-bikes-and-frames-%E2%80%94-great-rides-cyclings-traditional)
- Super strong, so all the tubes will be the skinniest ([looks great!](https://www.google.com/search?q=steel+bike+frames&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj587yNqc7YAhUwRN8KHf2UAz0Q_AUICygC&biw=950&bih=994))
- Easy to repair -- can literally bend the steel back into place and it's good to go
- Absorbs TONS of road shock for comfy rides
- Tends to make the heaviest frames, though not always
	- Is lightened by being "butted" in places the tube doesn't have to be thick

# [Aluminum](https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/trends/aluminum-frames-are-back-and-better-ever)
- Not as strong as steel, so tubes have to be thicker to support weight
- Harder to repair, usually requires some welding
- Doesn't absorb that much road shock (we say the frame is "stiff")
- Tends to make lighter frames, though not always
- Cheaper to produce post-1990, so modern bikes are usually aluminum

# [Carbon fiber (the dream)](http://road.cc/content/feature/211921-13-best-carbon-fibre-road-bikes-%C2%A3799-%C2%A310000)
- Also not as strong as steel, so tubes have to be thicker to support weight
- Fail [catastrophically](https://www.google.com/search?q=carbon+fiber+bike+crash&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiy3YHk9M3YAhWBUN8KHQmqDfAQ_AUIDCgD&biw=950&bih=994) in crashes (think splintering)
	- Can't DIY repair, need a professional
- Absorbs a lot of road shock, almost as much as steel
- Makes the lightest frames, though not always
- Expensive to produce
- NO WELDS -- pretty!

There is a small amount to be said of men vs women's frames. Stereotypically, women's frames curve abruptly downward after the seat so that women could wear skirts and bike. However, that's not all that seperates men's and women's bikes. Women's bikes can have different inseam:torso ratios, and be fine-tuned to support different bone structure supporting weight at different parts of the body. Ultimately, though, I haven't met any women who claimed it made a huge difference, and more often than not the only real difference is in the color scheme. I feel very confident saying that men can ride women's bikes very comfortably, and women can ride men's bikes the same. It just doesn't make **that big** a difference to amateurs, and it makes no sense to filter by that at this price-point.

## 3. Understanding wheels and other components
The biggest factor about the wheel is the size tire it can support. Wider tires mean you can go on rougher terrain/carry more, but you'll have substantially more rolling resistance, which will slow you down. Weight and aerodynamics do matter, but not nearly as much to us amateur riders.

Components are... complicated. They've been letting you shift gears and brake since the inception of bicycles, but the way they do that has changed, and everyone has their own preferences. There are some globally agreed on facts, though:

1. Shimano parts are good
	- (Worst-best): Shimano Claris, Shimano Sora, Shimano Tiagra, Shimano 105, Shimano Ultegra, Shimano Dura-Ace
	- Better systems also have more gears! I reccomend anything Sora or above!
2. SRAM parts are good, but a little less popular [(and different from Shimano.)](http://road.cc/content/buyers-guide/206156-head-head-shimano-105-v-sram-rival-22-%E2%80%94-how-do-two-cheapest-11-speed)
3. Campy parts are amazing (fanatics go crazy for Campy), but expensive

It's pretty hard to learn which components work well together with which, but thankfully bike manufacturers take care of that part for you. If you want to learn more about what each of those parts of your bike does, instead of watching 5+ hours of tutorials online like I did, buy [some cheap tools](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_1_9/140-5840151-4715015?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=bike+tool+kit&sprefix=bike+tool%2Caps%2C126&crid=38BYVW8P2CC4R) and get out there and actually [take apart a bike yourself!](http://www.jimlangley.net/wrench/wrench_images/bicycle_parts_labeled.jpg)

## 4. Understanding comfort
"Geometry" is the term we use to describe exactly how a bike positions its rider on the bicycle (think a [Harley with high handlebars](http://www.usabobbers.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Ape-Hanger-Handlebars-On-Motorcycle.jpeg) vs. a bike from [Tron](http://www.musclecarszone.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/TRON-BIKE-Made-By-Mark-Parker-From-PARKER-BROTHERS-CHOPPERS-1.jpg)). Every bike's geometry is different (and can't be changed *that* much by the seatpost), so the only way to really know the geometries you like is to try different bikes! Faster bikes tend to have more aggressive/uncomfortable geometries that position the rider higher up and with a more straight back, but it all depends on the size of the person, so your mileage ***will*** vary.

Seats ($30), handlebars ($50), and handlebar tape ($10) are all really cheap to replace on a used bike, and add to comfort. You can take straight bars off a bike and put on curved road bars easily ($40). Tri/aero bars can be added for $40, but aren't needed for the class at all. In a wind tunnel or long race, maybe. If you like them, [go for it,](https://www.amazon.com/hybike-Triathlon-Aerodynamic-Position-Handlebars/dp/B071VPRJ11/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?ie=UTF8&qid=1515614945&sr=8-1-spons&keywords=aero+bars&psc=1) they're clip-on.

## 5. BicycleBlueBook quotes
This is the best way to price-verify used bikes. All you have to do is look at the picture on Craigslist, and search the name of the manfucturer/model on Google followed by "blue book." Given the frame, components, age of the bicycle (and sometimes past sales), BicycleBlueBook gives a pretty accurate estimate of what any bicycle is actually worth (although it usually undervalues ~5-10%). It also doesn't account for the scarcity of good used bikes for sale, nor the immediacy of your need for the class, so be willing to spend a little more than the quote. If you find a deal under the quote, make sure it isn't too good to be true! The MSRP (Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price) is likely what the owner paid for it, so put that in context.

## 6. Applying 2-4 to inspection
Remember: you're investing in a frame, you can't replace that! So inspect the frame thoroughly for any cracks (not in the paint), and question the owner endlessly if it was ever in a crash. If it was, don't buy it. You're risking your safety.

Inspect the wheels and make sure they have enough air (obviously). Ensure you can see the textures cut into the brake pads, and that the brakes work. Make sure the rims of the wheels where the brakes touch is similarly textured and not smooth. If either are smooth, your braking power is severely limited.

Check the tension on the chain by pulling it on the side of a gear. If it feels loose or comes out more than .75cm, the components are old and need to be replaced (you can't just replace the chain.) That's pretty expensive for a used bike you're just now buying, so I wouldn't buy it.

Check if the tires are true (no wobbling when they spin). If not, don't worry, our shop will do it for free on Fridays from 3:00-6:00pm.

While riding, you're looking for three things:
1. Does the frame absorb the road well?
	- If it's hellish, it'll be hellish on our track. Don't buy it.
2. Do the gears change smoothly?
	- If you can't reach the highest or lowest gears, you an adjust [these things](https://www.fezzari.com/img/support/RdRrDerailleur.jpg) when you get off the bike. After you adjust, grab the derailleur and make sure it can reach that gear it couldn't reach before!
3. Am I having fun?
	- If not, try a faster/comfier/more your style bike.

### Conclusion
[Biking encourages frugal behavior,](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/05/07/what-do-you-mean-you-dont-have-a-bike/) and I can attest to their crazy usefulness. Bikes have close to zero-maintenance, and the little maintenance is cheap. Spending more money up front if you're going to be using the bike 2-3 years from now is totally worth it, and if you're in college you should be using a bike 2-3 years from now no matter if you're working or still in college. Because of that and how cheaply made department store bikes are, it's a no brainer to go with the next tier up.
