I did that because I value your data bill and places which are just now getting emerging internet. I'm also a minimalist.</p><figure><img src="./road-runner.jpg" alt="Road runner" /><figcaption>This is exactly how my site gets delivered to you.</figcaption></figure><p>I didn't want to make any compromises on my developer experience, though. Writing should be fun and easy (this is a creative outlet, after all!) and deployment should only take one click. That was my main gripe with my the last version of this site.</p><p>Enter <a href="https://gatsbyjs.org">Gatsby</a>, a framework to pipeline data (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>) onto webpages using templates. However, the 200kb Gatsby weighs in at for Hello World is just to big compared to the 10kb for my last Jekyll blog. On emerging 3G that's still 2-3 seconds to load 200kb for what is maybe only 5kb of content!</p><figure><img src="./gatsby-logo.jpg" alt="Gatsby logo" /><figcaption><a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org">GatsbyJS</a> is a nice way to write modern React+JSX without compromising much on SEO and speed.</figcaption></figure><p>I didn't just blindly adopt Gatsby, though. I value understanding how a system works completely, and there were too many things I didn't understand. I wanted to NOT include JS on pages that didn't need them and to use <a href="https://preactjs.com">Preact</a> to make the ones that needed JS (like my <a href="/posts/money/early-retirement">retirement projector</a>) even lighter. No one else seems to want that. Everyone else seems to be okay with the bloat.</p><p>I wanted to optimize that, so I got down and dirty for two weeks and ripped Gatsby apart to include the bare minimum needed to render. The result is what you now see.</p><p>This page is proof that with some webpack customization and learning Gatsby internals, it's possible to make tiny static pages IN REACT that don't even ship React.js to the browser!
It's what I've been looking for since it's the most elegant and customizable way to control content I ship to your browser.
I understand how every line of HTML, CSS, and Javascript got there (preferably without Javascript), and that makes me want to write more content with higher quality, which should be the whole point of the internet.</p><p>If you're into the technical aspects, check out the section below!</p><figure><img src="show-me-the-source-yoda.jpg" alt="Show me the source" /><figcaption>Use the source, Luke!</figcaption></figure><h1>How I Made the Site</h1><h3>Gatsby Internals I Tore Apart</h3><p>Everyone loves a great tear.
