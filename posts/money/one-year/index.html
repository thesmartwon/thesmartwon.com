I could never live off <a href="../early-retirement">$24,000</a> like my retirement calculator's estimate is based off. I could do it off $13,717, which includes cheap rent at home and even an overkill $1,700 server for stock analysis.</p><h2>Income</h2><p>With a bachelor's degree I make above what my <a href="https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/future-students/">college department's website says,</a> but not by much. I've taken advantage of my company's 3% matching 401k and HSA plans, which I maxed for the year 2019. I'm very fortunate.</p><h2>Expenses</h2><p>Category|Amount|Comments
