It's time to come clean. I could never live off [$24,000](../early-retirement) like my retirement calculator's estimate is based off. I could do it off $13,717, which includes cheap rent at home and even an overkill $1,700 server for stock analysis.

## Income
With a bachelor's degree I make above what my [college department's website says,](https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/future-students/) but not by much. I've taken advantage of my company's 3% matching 401k and HSA plans, which I maxed for the year 2019. I'm very fortunate.

## Expenses
