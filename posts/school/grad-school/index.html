Sick of school, sick of hearing that I need to pursue more school, and not really caring what field I end up in, I decided to find out the truth about salaries myself. Near the bottom of my Computer Science <a href="https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/future-students/">department's website,</a> I found out that the average Computer Science undergrad makes $72k, while the average graduate makes $102k. Also, <a href="https://studentservices.ncsu.edu/your-money/financial-aid/estimated-cost-of-attendance/undergraduate-student/">tuition</a> is around $9k at the time of this post. Also, we'll presume interest rates are at a conservative 7%. Well, get strapped in for some math!</p><p>To get a Master's, it'll cost me $9k * 4 semesters + $72k * 2 years = <strong>$180k</strong>. We can even be technical and subtract the part time jobs I work during the semester now, which would be $20k/year at most. Then, it'll cost me $180k - $20k = <strong>$160k</strong> to get my Master's, which can be paid back in just 3 years of working my new fancy graduate job, right?</p><h1 id="wrong">Wrong.</h1><p>You have to look at the <em><strong>difference</strong></em> between $102k and $72k, which is only $30k. In that case, it will take $160k / $30k = <strong>5 years</strong> to pay off the <em>opportunity cost</em> of grad school, not a meager 3! Not to mention that all the money I save by graduating early (at least 50%) is going to be growing in <a href="https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/05/18/how-to-make-money-in-the-stock-market/">index funds</a> at an effective rate of 7%, which will amount to an <strong>extra $29k</strong> over those 5 years. On the flip side, the graduate student will be in debt $36k, and have a <em>negative</em> interest rate on that!</p><h2 id="5-years-in-the-future">5 years in the future</h2><p>But oh, I'm not so Smart if I don't factor in after those 5 years. Most people work 40 years, so getting that extra $30k/year really pays off in the long term, doesn't it? Nope. <em>How many 40 year olds in computer science get paid more because they have a Master's?</em> Also, do you really want to work longer? Personally, I want to <a href="/posts/money/early-retirement">go crazy and retire in my 30s</a> so I can go out and make a difference in the world doing what I love, not stuck behind a desk until I'm so old I only have 20% of my weakened life left.</p><p>Let's say even with lots of career progression it will take me 5 years to &quot;catch up&quot; to a master degree's salary, and that it happens in one big pay raise. Then I'm losing the starting gap over 5 years, which is ($102k - 72k) * 5 = $150k, still less than $152k I lose by going to school. Once you factor in the 3% income tax bracket jump at $92k over 5 years, it's closer to around $140k. Also, you have to factor in that I'm going to be saving at least half my salary for those 2 years in <a href="https://www.google.com/search?tbm=fin&amp;q=NYSEARCA:+SPY">index funds</a>, which amounts to 70*1.07^5=$28k extra over those 5 years, which will compound even more in nice IRAs over my lifetime. So really, getting a Master's would lose me around $152k + $28k - $140k = <strong>$40k in just 5 years!</strong></p></div></main></div><footer><a href="#">Back to top</a> / <a href="/posts/">View all posts</a></footer></body></html>
