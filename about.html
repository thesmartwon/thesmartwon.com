Now it's just a place for me to share my experiences with those who want a little more wisdom.</p><h4>Who am I?</h4><p>I'm an early college grad who's been programming since elementary school. I plan to rush to financial independence in less than 10 years so I can work on what I want instead of what my employers want. Some things I think are cool are <a href="https://polygon.io">automated trading</a>, <a href="http://wiki.sc2ai.net/Main_Page">Starcraft 2 AI</a>, <a href="https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/index.shtml">reverse engineering</a>, and on the less technical side I love God, cooking, and kids! I'm sure as I get older I'll post about those things instead...</p><p>It's safe to say the following blogs changed my life and inspired me to make this won. You should read them.<ul><li><a href="https://zachholman.com">Zach Holman</a> on tech and its culture from California</li><li><a href="https://www.mrmoneymustache.com">Mr. Money Mustache</a> on how to be frugal</li></ul></p></div></div></div></body></html>
